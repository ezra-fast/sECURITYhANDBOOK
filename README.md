# Security Handbook

This is an ongoing personal project dedicated to indexing all relevant offensive and defensive security resources into a single, organized document. A well rounded security professional must have a thorough knowledge of the digital underworld, which is why this list also contains samples and indexes of live malware, criminal forums, lesser known peer to peer networks, and search engines to navigate the dark web. Each entry has a brief description that allows for this list to be searched based on keyword. The compilation and organization of this list is still ongoing and will be semi-frequently updated.
